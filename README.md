# SweetLanding — Pure CSS Training Site (with a dash of JS)

A small training project to practice **clean HTML/CSS** layout: grids, typography, responsive blocks, simple transitions, and basic interactivity **without frameworks or build tools**.  
A tiny bit of **vanilla JS** is used for the modal, burger menu, and minor UI interactions.

## 🎯 Goal

- Practice **page structure** and **BEM-style class naming**.  
- Train **Flexbox/Grid** layouts, buttons, lists, and cards.  
- Build simple interactions: burger menu, accordion, modal.  
- Keep the stack minimal: **plain HTML/CSS/JS** only.

## ✨ What’s Included

- **Header** with logo, navigation, and burger menu.
- **Hero** section with title, buttons, and circular SVG text.
- **Products** grid with images and `<details>` for extra info.
- **How it’s made?** section with image and text.
- **Why us?** feature cards with icons and numbers.
- **Gallery** image grid.
- **Locations** cards + CTA buttons.

## 🛠 Tech

- **HTML5** — semantic markup.  
- **CSS3** — Flexbox/Grid, transitions, decorative elements.  
- **Vanilla JS** — modal/burger/accordion (`popup.js`, `main.js`).  
- **No bundlers** — open `index.html` directly.
